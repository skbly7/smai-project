### Intro

* What is intrusion detection
* Dataset information
* related work 
    * paper we are following
   

### What needs to be done & how

* Scope & what is done
    * what all done
        * svm (linear, c=1)
        * neural networks
        * with pcaf
        * with ffr
    * how to represent
        * confusion matrix (in neural netwrok)
        * classification report (cr)
        * data vs time graph
* future work
    * phase 1
        * adfa dataset
            * windows avaialble
            * defacto standard
        * reduce false negative
            * neive baise classifier
                * cost matrix (clresults.html)
            * read more research paper
            * normal can be as attack but not vice-versa
    * phase 2
        * u2r attacks rare, to detect it
            * data distribution
        * attack prevention demonstration
            * realtime notification
            * time reduce while testing (to achieve realtime)
